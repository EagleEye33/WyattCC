- The application now features the delete and update components thus finishing the CRUD application
- There is an experimental CSRF protection that was added, but was causing an error to the 'delete' button of the delete component; currently that line of code is commented out to provide a working delete componenet.
- A few screenshots are provided that show the update page and the 'edit' page for my own information. The 'update' component was the most involved part and is why I included two screenshots of it. Following in complexity is the 'create' component as there is no need to connect to another page. The delete and read parts were comparatively simpler. 


Obviously this project is simply to learn about php, PDO(php data object) and connecting to mySQL. What I learned here will be used in a more complete project and most likely a fullstack application.
