- notifymycrypto currently only displays the historical price in USD(past 10 hours) for bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin.
- each coin price is set to update every 10 seconds
- there is also an option to view all three coins at once to get an idea of much their prices differ.
- in addition to building the notification system for the coins I plan to add an option to select a list of coins, as well as a list to select the type of historical data. I plan to make and keep the yearly historical data to be the only one to extend back to the creation of the selected coin.

The css of the site is still a work in progress and the background serves only as an experiment. I aim to get all the functionality working first before tinkering with the sites look and feel. 

Currently the api for historical data will have to be updated as I am only allowed a certain number of calls per month. I believe I have found another api that allows unlimited calls.

Additionally, I will most likely make and keep each cryptocurrency graph updating every hour with perhaps a few options on how often the user would like to see the graph update.
