<span style = "color:black;font-size:larger;">Hey, I'm Wyatt.</span> 

I am math tutor living in [Gilbert, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert,_Arizona){:target="_blank"}

I graduated with a degree in mathematics from ASU back in May 2020 at the height of the pandemic...
currently I am transitioning into a web development career and hence the purpose of this website is to showcase what I am working on/worked on.

As of right now this website is dedicated to programming projects and serves as a virtual resume.

- Projects are usually related to website development
- You can see a growing list of related technologies I have learned at the [home page]({% link _pages/03_home.md | prepend: site.baseurl %})
